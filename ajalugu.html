	<h1>A Little About Video Games' History &#x1f579;&#xfe0f;</h1>

	<article>
    <p><strong>A video game</strong> is an electronic game that involves interaction with a user interface or<br>
         input device to generate visual feedback for a player.</p>
    <p>Then it is shown on a 2D or 3D video display device or virtual reality headset.<br>
    Video games are augmented with audio feedback and optionally with other types of feedback systems.<br>
    Video games are defined based on their platform - <strong>arcade games</strong>, <strong>console games</strong> and <strong>PC games</strong>.<br>
    More recently, the industry has expanded onto <strong>mobile gaming</strong>.</p>

	<p>Video games are classified into a wide range of genres based on their type of gameplay and purpose.</p>
    

    <h2>First Video Game And It's Developer</h2>

	<p id="Tennis">The world’s first video game is Tennis For Two<br>
		It was the first computer game to be created purely as an entertainment product<br>
		rather than for academic research or commercial technology promotion</p>
	<p>It was created by physicist <em title="Reeeeeeeally cool dude!">William Higinbotham</em> and shown on October 18, 1958.</p>

    <h2>Evolution Of Video Games</h2>
    
    <p>As the time passed by and technologies developed the video games changed too.<br>
	Best way to show it is to compare some older video games with some new ones.</p>
	

	<table>
	<tr><td>
	<p id="Space"><strong>1973. Space Race</strong></p>
	<p>Space Race was the second game by the<br>
	company Atari, Inc., after <strong>Pong</strong> (1972), which marked <br>
	the beginning of the commercial video game industry</p>

	</td>
	<td>
	<p id="Pac-Man"><strong>1980. Pac-Man</strong></p>
	<p>The Pac-Man video game franchise remains one of the<br>
	highest-grossing and best-selling game series of all time,<br>
	generating more than $14 billion in revenue (as of 2016) and <br>
	$43 million in sales combined.</p>

	</td></tr>
	

	<tr><td>
	<p id="Mario"><strong>1990. Super Mario World</strong></p>
	<p>Super Mario World was produced during the console wars<br>
	– a result of the rivalry between Nintendo's SNES and<br>
	Sega's two-year-old Mega Drive system.<br>
	Nintendo has sold 20.61 million copies of the game<br>
	worldwide, making it the bestselling game for the SNES.</p>

	</td>
	<td>
	<p id="Banjo"><strong>2000. Banjo Tooie</strong></p>
	<p>The graphics were considered some of the best<br>
	on the Nintendo 64 due to their rich textures,<br>
	long drawing distance, and real-time shadow generation,<br>
	but were criticised for their inconsistent frame rate during <br>
	certain points in the game.</p>

	<tr><td>
	<p id="GOW"><strong>2010. God Of War III</strong></p>
	<p>Upon release, God of War III received countless positive<br>
	review scores with critics praising the game’s brutal<br>
	combat, impressive visuals and grand scale.<br>
	In his review of the game, Joe Juba of website<br>
	Gameinformer gave the game a perfect 10 out of 10, and<br>
	concluded his article by saying that<br>
	“Not even in my wildest dreams could I have imagined such<br>
	a powerful, cinematic, and breathtaking conclusion to the<br>
	saga of the Ghost of Sparta.”</p>

	</td>
	<td>
	<p id="Creed"><strong>2020. Assassin's Creed: Valhalla</strong></p>
	<p>Assassin’s Creed Valhalla would undoubtedly benefit from<br>
	Nvidia’s DLSS technology which uses machine learning to<br>
	improve image quality and performance.<br>
	Valhalla represents Ubisoft's "flagship" game for<br>
	these next-generation systems, and has been developed to take<br>
	advantage of faster loading times both new consoles offer.<br>
	Players on Xbox One or PlayStation 4 are able to upgrade their game to<br>
	the next-gen version on their respective platform at no extra cost. </p>
